# ExcaliKey

I made this repository to understand how drawing apps work and my inspiration is Excalidraw. That's why the name Excalikey.

## Usage

You can draw various shapes and also change their fill and stroke after they are drawn by selecting them.

Apart from the general features we also have some options that you can choose to draw what you want

- Select a shape to change it's properties
- Draw a rectangle
- Draw a triangle

## Algorithms

I am indebted to this wonderful site on geometric algorithms [Geomalgorithms](https://geomalgorithms.com/). It provided an indepth explanation of how the particular algorithm worked, which edge cases should be considered and it would had been much harder to implement without it.

I've read two papers listed below.

- [Fast winding algorithm](https://geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html)
- [Areas of triangles and polygons](https://geomalgorithms.com/a01-_area.html)
