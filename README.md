I made this repository to understand how drawing apps work because I was very much inspired by Excalidraw and I wanted to build one myself. That's why the name Excalikey.

Apart from the general features we also have some options that you can choose to draw what you want

- Draw a rectangle
- Draw a triangle

## Algorithms

I am indebted to this wonderful site on geometric algorithms [Geomalgorithms](https://geomalgorithms.com/). It provided an indepth explanation of how the particular algorithm worked, which edge cases should be considered and it would had been much harder to implement without it.

I've read two papers listed below.

- [Fast winding algorithm](https://geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html)
- [Areas of triangles and polygons](https://geomalgorithms.com/a01-_area.html)
